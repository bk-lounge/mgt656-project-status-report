    <h3>Sprint Write-up</h3>
        <p>
            In the same vein of the first sprint, we began this sprint by 
            breaking down all the remaining user stories into individual sprint 
            items and sorted them in terms of difficulty (expected time for 
            completion). For ideal work distribution, we chose individual sprint
            items and balanced the workload for each team member.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drew was assigned the sprint items about building out the RSVP 
            functionality. This was accomplished by adding a form to the event 
            detail creation page, which used an HTML form and a post request. 
            Then, we built out a simple validation check that ensured that only 
            Yale email addresses were accepted as RSVPs, case insensitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            David created the event-creating form for the project. It has the 
            attribute method="POST" and also requires users to specify the 
            following attributes of an event: title, location, image, year, 
            month, day, hour, and minute. This resulted in a decrease in story 
            points by 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chew then completed the form validation part of project - which 
            primarily included error checking. The form for creating new events 
            now display errors to the user when the inputted time (year, month, 
            day, hour) is incorrect. Furthermore, the form also now checks if 
            the uploaded image is in the acceptable formats - GIF, PNG or URL. 
            In addition, location and event title is now limited to between 5 
            and 50 characters. Ultimately, 4 story points were completed.
        </p>
    <h3>Next Sprint</h3>
        <p>
            At the end of this sprint, our team was given an additional few
            user stories. In the next sprint, the main feature we need to add
            is tracking of users. This will be done through the use of 
            referral headers, and by adding donation links to the event pages.
            Hopefully, this will allow us to better target our intended users,
            and focus on new features that get the most traffic. Additionally,
            we need to style the whole site to improve the user experience 
            across the board.
