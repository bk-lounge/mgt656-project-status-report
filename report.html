    <h3>Sprint Write-up</h3>
        <p>
            Upon the completion of the first two sprints, 3 additional story points were added to increase the visibility and functionality of our website. We included the last sprints story points in our current burn down chart to give added context, since this sprint was expected to be shorter. We were tasked with profiling our users and running A/B testing to determine optimal site features, in addition to a self-imposed site redesign.
        </p>
        <p>
            David and Chew gathered additional details about the first new user story (aka went to office hours). We determined that we needed to install some analytics software to be able to track our users by referral and determine who went to what pages on the site. Additionally, we decided to run some A/B testing on both the home page and the event detail pages to encourage RSVPs and donations, respectively. Finally, we decided on a modern redesign for the site, including transparent overlay and a scrolling background.
        </p>
        <p>
            For our site redesign, we attempted to go with a modern bootstrap-y look. We added a navbar to the top of all pages, which includes links to the homepage, the about page, the API, and we added a dropdown of all events. We also added a semi-transparent container to hold the main content of each page, and a scrolling background using Backstretch.js jquery library.
        </p>
        <h4>User Analytics</h4>
        <p>
            First, we got google analytics up and running. After a slight hiccup with the source of traffic (out of our control), we had reports coming in on the flows of different users. Unfortunately, due to unspecified technical difficulties, we were only able to capture the referral sites from yale.edu. However, we could see the flows and determined that the all events page was rarely visited, and instead users clicked right to the event detail pages. So we removed that link from the homepage, and instead added a dropdown menu of all events onto the navbar. A graphic of the user flow is below.

        <p>
            Next, we added A/B testing to our code using google analytics. The first test we added was if adding the word RSVP to the events on the homepage increased our click-through rate. As of yet, the tests are inconclusive, but we did see increased traffic and donations when the word "RSVP" was present, with a 16% conversion rate with "RSVP" vs a 6% conversion rate without. A graphic of this is included below. This will undergo further analysis in later sprints.

    <h3>Project Retrospective</h3>
        <p>
            This project was a great introduction to project management and the basics of web app design using HTML, CSS, and JS/node. While the techinical challenges weren't great (and were greatly alleviated by Kyle's helpful videos), they did become greater towards the end of the project. The introduction to agile scrum and its use in a team setting were much more poignant (as the course was designed) and provided a great learning experience for our team. We enjoyed the project and would recommend the class in the future.
        </p>
    <h3>Next Sprint</h3>
        <p>
            In future sprints, we will further analyze the user statistics and add more A/B tests to tailor our design and content to our core users.
        </p>
